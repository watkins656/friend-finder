Friend Finder is an app that will match you with a person who shares similar interests or views with you.  You answer a series of questions, with a score of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).  The scores are then compared with all available friends and your closest match is returned.

This is a heroku app, used in a browser.
